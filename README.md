# Fish_weight_pred
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the weight of a fish based on various physical characteristics. The model is deployed on Heroku, allowing users to input fish measurements through a web interface and receive real-time weight predictions.

Features
Machine Learning Model: Predicts fish weight using regression techniques.
Frontend: User-friendly web interface built with HTML/CSS.
Deployment: Hosted on Heroku for easy access.
 Dataset
The dataset used is the Fish Market Dataset, which contains measurements like length, height, and width of different fish species.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy)
Flask (Backend API for model inference)
HTML/CSS (Frontend)
Heroku (Deployment)
Git & GitHub (Version control)
